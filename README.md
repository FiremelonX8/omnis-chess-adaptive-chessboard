Omnis Chess: Development of a Chess Game Adapted for People with Upper Limb Physical Disabilities Through Open-Source Hardware and Software

The Omnis Chess project aims to promote inclusion for people with physical disabilities in the upper limbs in chess practice. IBGE data shows that 3.7% of the Brazilian population has some sort of disability in superior limbs, evidencing the necessity of the development of assistive technology focused on them. According to Law No. 13.146/2015, people with disabilities are entitled to equality in all aspects, including sports and leisure activities. The objective, therefore, is to develop an autonomous chess system capable of recognizing voice commands in Portuguese and moving pieces on the chessboard automatically. It is then implemented a system with a microcomputer Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, open-source libraries - python-chess, for the game logics, SpeechRecognition (online) and vosk (offline) for speech recognition, the latter alongside a Kaldi model. The physical structure is based on a core-XY mechanism, usual in CNC printers, controlled by stepper motors. Partial results show the functioning of the online technologies integration, while the offline version still requires optimization to get accurate responses to chess-specific commands. Subsequently, the software will be integrated into the physical prototype and user testing will begin, ensuring Omnis Chess effectively promotes social inclusion.
